# Vault SDK

Early TypeScript SDK for interacting with Centrifuge vaults. It provides helper functions to read onchain metadata and fetch drift metrics generated by `VaultDriftIndexer`.

## Installation

This folder is not published yet. You can import it in a TypeScript project via a relative path or by copying the sources.

## Usage

```ts
import { VaultSDK } from './vault-sdk'
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.example')
const registry = '0xRegistryAddress'

const sdk = new VaultSDK(provider, registry)
const vaults = await sdk.listVaults()
console.log(vaults)
```

`listVaults()` returns the metadata stored in `VaultRegistry` for all registered vaults.

```ts
const composition = await sdk.getComposition('0xVault', '0xHoldings')
console.log(composition)
```

`getComposition()` aggregates vault asset configs with live values from `IHoldings` to calculate the current weights.

```ts
const queue = await sdk.getRedemptionQueue('0xVault')
console.log(queue)
```

`getRedemptionQueue()` sums pending and claimable redeem requests for the vault and can optionally take a user address as second parameter.
